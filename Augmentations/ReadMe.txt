[h1]You have not asked for this[/h1]

This mods allows your soldiers to be augmented with several cybernetic augmentations.

There is a new research called "Cybernetic" which can be researched after Hybrid Materials.

Once researched you can build diverse Cybernetic parts in the proving ground.

Higher tier parts also require higher armor research like plated armor or power armor.

As soon as you have build a part you can augment a soldier by clicking on the new "Augmentations" menu item in the soldier menu.

When augmenting a body part it gets replaced by the new cosmetics this mod provided (this behavior can be disabled in the ini).

The cosmetic are fully tintable and pattern can be applied. The color of emissive parts like eyes can be changed via the eye color menu.

Its save to add this mod mid campaign

[h1]New wound mechanic[/h1]

Augmenting soldiers reduce their healing time when they are wounded.

However when your soldier gets gravely wounded he gets assigned a body part randomly 
which needs to be augmented in order to heal again at all.
E.g his legs are critically wounded beyond repair and need to be replaced.

[h1]Why the vest slot dependency?[/h1]

Cybernetic torsos provide a free vest slot to your soldiers. Normal soldiers do *not* get a free vest slot with this mod active.
