You created an XCOM 2 Mod Project!

Cyberlegs: Blunt amputation and replacement of the leg. Run faster, jump farther, move better. Unsurprisingly the augmentation is obvious and might make the subject stand out in a given social environment.

Synthetic Leg Muscles: Vatgrown myomer fibers grafted into the subject's legs allow for greater overall strength without much impact on an agent's ability to infiltrate into advent dominated society.

Walker Servos: Extremely specialized servomotors placed at critical points in locomotor anatomy allow the subject greater speed and tactical capability.

Elite Walker Servos: The absolute penultimate advancement in servomotor technology providing a given subject with serious tactical advantages in the field. 

Elite Silent Runners: A complex interweave of biological and mechanical advancements worked into a subjects locomotor structures allowing complete silence during movement. With training they should be impossible to locate until it is too late.

Cyberarms: Full replacement of a given manipulator limb. All joints and digits are upgraded with the intent of improving fine motor control and application of force.

Cybergrapple: A blunt term for a complex series of artificial muscles and control systems designed to grant the user serious advantages in close quarters combat.

Cyberclaws: The given weaponry varies in design but the end result is the same, portable, easy to use sharp implements that can be deployed and used for violence at short notice.

Elite Cyberclaws: Advanced alloys, sharpening techniques, modular construction and specialized training regimen give the subject not just an easy to conceal melee weapon but the means to use it effectively.

Wrist Launcher: Serious augmentation of the subject's arm creates a mount for weaponry usually rated for vehicles or combat drones. Particular attention has been paid to the shoulder to minimize thoracic damage from recoil.

Elite Wrist Launcher: Further augmentation of the user's manipulation limb as well as their nervous system allowing the user to more effectively wield weaponry usually considered well outside the range of man portable equipment.

Cybertorso: Complete Thoracic modification, organs moved and modified where required. Storage compartments added, armor plating applied. Should be easy to conceal with a decent shirt barring serious modification or original design.

Distortion Field: A man portable defensive field that provides allies with some small defense against enemy action. Of little use against direct explosives but it can aid against shrapnel and indirect fire.

Elite Distortion Field: A More advanced model capable of providing greater protection against enemy fire. A combination of predictive simulations, communication networking, and energy fields allow field agents to avoid enemy action with greater dependability. 

Self Repairing Nano-Coating: A complex system of internal self repair systems that can, in theory, bring a given subject back from the edge of death.

Self Repairing Nano-Coating MK2: Improvements on delivery system and on the fly improvisation from the AI in control of the repair system grant the subject greater resilience in the field.

Cyberskull: Complete or as close to possible replacement of the skull. Serious improvement in the subject's ability to withstand head trauma. Eyes are usually replaced with superior prosthetics.

Neural Gunlink: Implantation of artificial neural cluster programmed with ballistic calculations allowing the user to account for factors like weapon weight, windspeed, gravity and so on. Updates can be delivered via injection.

Neural Tactical Processor:  Implantation of artificial nervous system tissues that account for various battlefield factors. Commonly called the 'triggernometry' implant by field agents it uses not just its user's data but squad networking for greater effectiveness.

Extra-Reactive Pupils: A reductive name as this system also includes several grams of biomechanical material that allow the user to re-assess a given situation and make better targeting decisions.

Hyper-Reactive Pupils: Modifications to the nerves in the arms and thoracic region along with updated wetware allow the user greater capabilities in accounting for unforeseen factors when it comes to making a followup shot.

Weakpoint Analyzer: A significant portion of the user's frontal lobe is modified and given artificial neurons that allow them to detect and act on perceived weaknesses. 

Elite Weakpoint Analyzer: Improvements to the initial system include regular updates to known weaknesses uploaded by field agents who survive engagements, as well as data from autopsies and system analysis by a dedicated team.

Full Conversion Therapy: The subject completely abandons their biological origins in favor of a custom crafted body. Known side effects are a weakness to certain psionic disciplines but strongwilled subjects should have nothing to fear and the resulting product is usually unstoppable short direct artillery fire.
